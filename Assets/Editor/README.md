# Testing
*In Unity there are two different kinds of tests: Play Mode and Edit Mode Tests.*

## Edit Mode Test
*Edit Mode tests (also known as Editor tests) are only run in the Unity Editor and have access to the Editor code.*

To run the Edit Mode Test got to 
Window > General > Test Runner > Edit Mode Test

## Play Mode Test
*You can run Play Mode tests as a standalone in a Player or inside the Editor. Play Mode tests allow you to exercise your game code, as the tests run as coroutines if marked with the UnityTest attribute.*

To run the Play Mode Test got to 
Window > General > Test Runner > Play Mode Test

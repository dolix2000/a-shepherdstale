# Boosts

Regarding perfomance and practical reason, this Script BoostBehaviour was created.
The script *BoostBehaviour* sums up the whole BoostFactory Scripts.
Since setting them in the Unity Scene itself is much easier and faster, than instantiating it through code (position, variety, type).

To test the boosts with the related Scripts to the BoostFactory go to

Game > Assets > Scenes > Test_Scenes > ItemTestScene

This scene holds the GameObject "Grid > Items" which holds the "BoostHandler" Script. In the inspector: the variety, type, and location can be set.

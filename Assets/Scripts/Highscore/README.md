# Highscore

Since our Titlemenu doesn't need another canvas, but only switches the views, scripts related
to the highscore were adjusted to fit the MVC Principle of the Menu.

To the test highscore independently go to 
Game > Assets > Scenes > Test_Scenes > HighscoreScene.

The HighscoreScene already holds the needed GameObjects with the scripts.
By starting the PlayMode the highscore gets loaded.
